Perfect! Based on your GitHub repo name and deployed link — **[Artist Vaala](https://artist-vala.vercel.app/)** — and since you'll upload homepage, about, and category screenshots, I’ll now prepare a beautiful `README.md` file with:

* 3D visual styling via markdown design tricks
* Emojis/icons for better appeal
* Project description
* Live demo link
* Feature list
* Tech stack
* Screenshots placeholders
* Setup instructions
* Contact & license

Once you upload the screenshots, I’ll add them to the final version. Here's a solid draft for now:
